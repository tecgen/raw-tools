# RAW Tools

RAW Tools are a set of Java classes and command line scripts 
which help me to handle Magic Lanterns RAW Video files or CinemaDNG clips better. They are mostly written in Java in order to be platform 
independent and can be used on OSX and Linux. 

#How to build?
* use Maven 3 to build the Java project (**mvn clean install**)
* all bash shell scripts are at least compatible with OSX 10.8.4, but its very likely that they are working on Linux as well
* user dependent configuration for the shell scripts is stored in **user.cfg**
